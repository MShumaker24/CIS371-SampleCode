# "Plain" ColorList (version 1)

This is an implementation of the ColorList example from the Porcello and Banks book using the 
"plain"/"straightforward" techniques discussed in Chapters 4-6.  

In other words, this is the version of ColorList that includes a fetch call to the API, but 
before the authors add refactoring, short-cuts, and network access.
